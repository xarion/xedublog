# The Push for Emotional Intelligence in Education
***

Many parents are displeased with the current state of the educational system, which often tends to prioritize academic achievement over the holistic development of students. As an experienced educational scientist and an advocate for a child's all-rounded development, I believe that an essential yet often undervalued ingredient to a child's success and well-being is emotional intelligence.

Emotional intelligence â€“ the ability to understand and manage one's emotions and those of others is just as important as cognitive intelligence when it comes to determining a person's success. Therefore, it is vital for emotional intelligence to be integrated into the curriculum of schools.

## Why Emotional Intelligence Matters

Emotional intelligence is crucial for a student's success because, despite conventional emphasis on academic intelligence, emotional intelligence plays a major role in overall personal achievement. It facilitates better focus in the classroom, increased recruitment and job retention rates, and improved mental well-being. Studies show that it has a greater influence on success than other factors.

Following up on our [previous post: The Overlooked Importance of Life Skills in Curriculum](/xedublog/education-fundamentals/the-overlooked-importance-of-life-skills-in-curriculum.md), it is evident that emotional intelligence, a critical life skill, should not remain overlooked in our curriculum.

## Integrating Emotional Intelligence Into The Curriculum

Integrating emotional intelligence into the curriculum begins with an understanding that education is not just about heading towards a career; it's about shaping individuals who can handle all of life's situations, including those that require interpersonal skills and emotional understanding. 

Classroom activities should incorporate team collaboration, problem-solving exercises, and role-plays. Teachers need training to be responsive to the emotional needs of students and create safe spaces where students can express their emotions openly. 

Furthermore, assessments should move beyond grading for academic work and include students' interpersonal skills, creativity, and emotional maturity. Our education system should also mandate counsellors in the school system who have the resources to help students deal with their emotional needs.

## What Can Parents Do?

Start by talking about emotions at home. Encourage your children to express their feelings and validate them. Model emotional intelligence through handling your own emotions responsibly.

Consider books, videos, and games that help children recognize and manage feelings. Encourage your older children to keep a journal where they can express their thoughts and emotions.

While you champion for emotional intelligence in your children's schools, start teaching it at home too.

In conclusion, this push for a more inclusive, emotionally intelligent system will not be rapid or easy. However, the long-term benefits that emotionally aware students bring to society make the challenge worthwhile.
