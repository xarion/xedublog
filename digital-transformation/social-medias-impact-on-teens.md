## Actionable Tips for Safe Usage of Social Media

Parents can play a pivotal role in ensuring that their children have a safe and beneficial social media experience. Here are some actionable tips:

1. **Establish Open Communication:** Discuss social media use with your children openly. Encourage them to share their experiences, and make sure they know they can come to you with concerns or problems.

2. **Educate About Risk**: Discuss the potential risks and negative aspects of social media. This includes cyberbully, privacy invasion, and the impact of peer comparison leading to low self-esteem or stress.

3. **Set Time Limitations**: Limit the amount of time your child spends on social media each day. Encourage them to engage in [extracurricular activities](/xedublogv2/holistic-development/the-role-of-extracurricular-activities-beyond-academics.md) or interactive outdoor play as it has [beneficial impacts](/v2/holistic-development/the-role-of-play-why-unstructured-time-matters.md) on their mental and physical development.

4. **Encourage Online Etiquette**: Just as you would teach your children manners offline, teach them online etiquette. This includes respecting the opinions of others, thinking before posting and understanding that what's shared online stays online.
  
5. **Use Privacy Settings:** Review the privacy settings on your child's social media accounts to ensure they're sharing information only with trusted contacts.

6. **Model Positive Behavior**: Last but not least, model the behavior you would like to see your child adopt. Limit your own social media use, and show your child there is a world beyond screens.
